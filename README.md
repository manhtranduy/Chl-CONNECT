# Chl-CONNECT
**Combination Of Neural Network models for Estimating Chlorophyll-a over Turbid and Clear Waters**

## Overview
Chl-CONNECT is a Python/MATLAB library designed for estimating chlorophyll concentrations for multiple satellite sensors including MODIS, MERIS, OLCI, and MSI. 
The library applies machine learning and statistical methods to predict chlorophyll concentrations and classify water body into different Optical Water Types.

## Usage

### Quick Start Example
#### Python Execution
To use Chl-CONNECT in Python:
```python
from common.Chl_CONNECT import Chl_CONNECT

# Initialize the Chl_CONNECT class with specified sensor data
chl_conn = Chl_CONNECT(Rrs_input=[Rrs412, Rrs443, Rrs488, Rrs531, Rrs551, Rrs667, Rrs748], sensor='MODIS')

# Retrieve chlorophyll concentrations and Optical Water Types
Chl_modis = chl_conn.Chl_comb
Class_modis = chl_conn.Class

from common.Chl_MuBR_NDCIbased import Chl_MuBR_NDCIbased

# Initialize the Chl_MuBR_NDCIbased class with specified sensor data
chl_mubr = Chl_MuBR_NDCIbased(Rrs_input=[Rrs412, Rrs443, Rrs490, Rrs510, Rrs560, Rrs665, Rrs709], sensor='OLCI')

# Retrieve chlorophyll concentrations and Optical Water Types
Chl_olci = chl_mubr.Chl_comb
Class_olci = chl_mubr.Class

```

#### MATLAB Execution
To use compute Chl-a in MATLAB:
```matlab
addpath('./common')

[Chl_modis,Class_modis]=Chl_CONNECT({Rrs412, Rrs443, Rrs490, Rrs531, Rrs551, Rrs665, Rrs748},'sensor','modis');

[Chl_olci,Class_olci]=Chl_MuBR_NDCIbased({Rrs412, Rrs443, Rrs490, Rrs510, Rrs560, Rrs665, Rrs709},'sensor','olci');
```
