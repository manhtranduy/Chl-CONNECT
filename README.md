# Chl-CONNECT
**Combination Of Neural Network models for Estimating Chlorophyll-a over Turbid and Clear Waters**

## Overview
Chl-CONNECT is a Python library designed for estimating chlorophyll concentrations for multiple satellite sensors including MODIS, MERIS, OLCI, and MSI. 
The library applies machine learning and statistical methods to predict chlorophyll concentrations and classify water body into different Optical Water Types.

## Usage

### Quick Start Example
#### Python Execution
To use Chl-CONNECT in Python:
```python
from Chl_CONNECT import Chl_CONNECT

# Initialize the Chl_CONNECT class with specified sensor data
chl_conn = Chl_CONNECT(Rrs_input=[Rrs412, Rrs443, Rrs488, Rrs531, Rrs551, Rrs667, Rrs748], sensor='MODIS')

# Retrieve chlorophyll concentrations and Optical Water Types
Chl = chl_conn.Chl
Class = chl_conn.Class
```

#### MATLAB Execution
To use Chl-CONNECT in Python:
```bash
from Chl_CONNECT import Chl_CONNECT

# Initialize the Chl_CONNECT class with specified sensor data
chl_conn = Chl_CONNECT(Rrs_input=[Rrs412, Rrs443, Rrs488, Rrs531, Rrs551, Rrs667, Rrs748], sensor='MODIS')

# Retrieve chlorophyll concentrations and Optical Water Types
Chl = chl_conn.Chl
Class = chl_conn.Class
```
